OpenCollar-OS
=============

This repository contains the code of the OpenSim port of OpenCollar

###The stable branch is OsCollar3 - a hybrid mainly based on OpenCollar 3.99x
This is a hybrid code base and uses the best working parts of several
branches. This branch is recommended for normal use.

###The unstable branch is OsCollar6 - based on OpenCollar master
Ideally we like to get this 100% working in OpenSim as many improvements
have been made by the OpenCollar developers.

The reference Collar of the OsCollar3 branch that will be available inworld
at a later time, will be using resources generously made available in the
OpenCollar 6 such as a mesh collar, textures, etc.

Refer to the Wiki for more information on this porting effort and how to help

Visit the Issue tracker to report any bugs you find. Be sure to include the
branch in your issue title that the bug occurs in (OsCollar3 or OsCollar6,
or both).
