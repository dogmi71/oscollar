### Welcome to OsCollar

OsCollar is a fork of OpenCollar, specifically optimized for OpenSim virtual worlds.

OsCollar is a set of LSL scripts and other creative content, such as animations, sounds, textures, graphics and 3D models, which can be used to create role play devices in the form of scripted accessory and/or so-called HUDs.

Punk, goth and fetish collars would be the most popular of those and OpenCollar eventually became everyone's script set of choice to create items that are used for creative role play amongst adults in Second LifeÂ®.

**A few words on authorship, years and copyright:**

OpenCollar source code has been composed by many different authors and while not all authors composed something in every year since 2008, we chose to state copyright as year spans (i.e. Copyright (c) 2008 - 2017) in our copyright notice.

We chose to do that in order to save space in a already cramped screen environment with in-world LSL editors. Nevertheless, we tried our best to make all authors appear in order of appearance if read from left to right. <3
