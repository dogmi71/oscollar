### Welcome to OpenCollar!

OpenCollar is a set of LSL scripts and all sort of creative content, such as motions, sounds, graphics and 3D models, which can be used to create role play devices for the metaverse. Traditionally such devices would take form as graphical interface worn on the "HUD" or as fashion accessory worn on the avatar herself.

Punk, goth and fetish collars would be the most popular of those and OpenCollar eventually became the basic standard device for this kind of creative role play amongst adults on Second LifeÂ®. OpenCollar is [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html "What is free software?").

#### OpenSim Porting Information

We target and test for OpenSim 0.8 (stable) and OpenSim 0.9 (unstable, master)

This is the oscollar3 branch, which is a port of OpenCollar 3.99x and considered legacy  
Check out the oscollar6 branch for a port based on the modern OpenCollar [six]  

There are some differences between v3 and v6 collars, for instance v6 is much more optimized thanks to certain scripts being in seperate links (which can be optionally invisible, but you do need them seperate).

If you are looking to directly convert or upgrade existing v3 collars for OpenSim, you can use this oscollar3 branch which should be 100% compatible with the last v3 version in Second Life. We haven't made a transmuter tool yet to convert a v3 collar to v6.

A ready made standard OpenCollar for both branches can be be aquired at the OsGrid Sim ['Kinky Hub'](http://opensimworld.com/hop/77066-Kinky-Hub). Creators can use this standard collar as a technical reference for making new products.
