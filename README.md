OpenCollar-OS
=============

This repository contains the code of the OpenSim port of OpenCollar

The stable branch is OsCollar3 - a hybrid mainly based on OpenCollar 3.99x

  This is a hybrid code base and uses the best working parts of several
  branches. This branch is recommended for normal use.

The unstable branch is OsCollar6 - based on OpenCollar master

  Ideally we like to get this 100% working in OpenSim as many improvements
  have been made by the OpenCollar developers.

The reference Collar of the OsCollar3 branch that will be available inworld
at a later time, will be using resources generously made available in the
OpenCollar 6 such as a mesh collar, textures, etc.
