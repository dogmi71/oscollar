Help make OsCollar better by contributing on GitHub.
Any help is welcome, from hacking to end user documentation.

Although OsCollar is a fork of OpenCollar and strives to be compatible,
please refrain from asking OpenSim specific support from OpenCollar as
OsCollar differs in some respects to work around OpenSim quirks/limitations.
